## Folder Structure

The frontend UI follows a modular folder structure to organize the codebase efficiently. Here's an overview of the main folders:

- `src`: Contains the main source code of the frontend UI.
  - `components`: Contains reusable UI components.
  - `services`: Contains services for interacting with backend APIs.
  - `pages`: Contains the main pages of the application.
  - `styles`: Contains global styles and theme configuration.
  - `utils`: Contains utility functions and helpers.
  - `tests`: Contains unit tests for components and services.

## Components

The frontend UI is built using a component-based architecture. Each component is responsible for a specific UI element or functionality. Here are some of the key components used in the application:

- `Header`: Renders the application header with navigation links.
- `Sidebar`: Displays a sidebar menu for easy navigation.
- `Button`: Provides a reusable button component with different styles and sizes.
- `Form`: Handles user input and validation for various forms.

## Services

Services in the frontend UI are responsible for interacting with backend APIs and handling data fetching and manipulation. Here are some of the main services used in the application:

- `AuthService`: Handles user authentication and authorization.
- `PaymentService`: Manages payment-related operations.
- `UserService`: Handles user-related operations.
